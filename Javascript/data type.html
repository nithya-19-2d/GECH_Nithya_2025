    <!--
    null is not an object, it is a primitive value in JavaScript.

    It represents the intentional absence of any value.

    The typeof operator just misreports it as "object" because of the historical bug.
    In the very first version of JavaScript (1995), values were stored as binary “tags” to indicate their type.

    Objects were represented with the binary tag 000.

    Unfortunately, null was also represented with the same tag (000), so the engine couldn’t distinguish between null
    and an object.

    That mistake got locked into the language.
    👉 Changing it later would have broken tons of existing code, so it stayed.*/-->
