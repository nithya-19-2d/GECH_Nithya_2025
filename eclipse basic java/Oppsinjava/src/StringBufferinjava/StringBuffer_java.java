      		 * In Java, beyond the String class, several other built-in classes are immutable, meaning their state cannot be changed after they are created. These include:
      Primitive Wrapper Classes: All the wrapper classes for primitive data types are immutable. This includes:
      1.Integer
      .2Byte
      3.Long
      4.Float
      5.Double
      6.Character
      7.Boolean
      8.Short
      ================
      Java 8 Date and Time API Classes (java.time package): 
      The classes introduced in the modern Date and Time API are designed to be immutable, ensuring thread-safety and predictable behavior. Examples include:
      1.LocalDate
      2.LocalTime
      3.LocalDateTime
      4.Instant
      5.ZonedDateTime
      =================

      BigInteger and BigDecimal: 
      ==========================
      These classes, used for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, are also immutable. 
      Operations on these objects return new instances with the modified values.
      ============================================================================
      StackTraceElement: 
This class, used in building exception stack traces, is immutable.
==================

Most enum classes: 
==================
While not a strict rule, most enum classes in the standard API are implicitly immutable, as their instances represent fixed constants.
======================================
File: 
====================
Although File objects represent external entities (files on the system) whose state can change, the File object itself, representing the path, is immutable.
Font and BasicStroke (from java.awt): These classes, used in graphics operations, are also immutable.*/
