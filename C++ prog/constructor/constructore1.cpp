/*
student std1, std2 ...
std1 is the object , that we created for the class, created multiple objects , that we called as instances of class, instances means copyies 

=> if we not  give the values to the getter and setter , it will take gaurbage value  and to avoid the repetative call of getter and setter, so avoid this we use constructor

Three types in constructor
===========================

default constructor // in jva no-arg constructor


constructor consist the name as same as we give to the class 
= and it is not does not contain the return type
= and it is declared using public modifier

automatically accessed using objects

Function 
=======
three levels   nad its also called member function
=> function declaration 
= function definition 
=function call

void add() function declaration
{

//code   // function definition
}

add() // function call


parameter constructor  =>add(parameters)
=====================
constructor with parameter =>constructor containes parameter

copy constructor  => (object)a1 = 1
                     a2 = 12
===============
we can give the value to the object by referencing the other object



Polymorphosimes
==============
constructor overloading
========================
using same(constructor name) method with different parameter




destructure 
===========
after the completion of task of class , it automatically called with tilt symbol and same name of class=> ~add() 
used to clear the memory occupied by the constructor
